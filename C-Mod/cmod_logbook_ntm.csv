1160714026,1.1,1.11,,,"mode analysis suggests 4/3 mode slowing down from 25 to 16kHz, t=1.1 :1.3sec"
1120927031,0.87,0.88,,,
1120927023,0.9,0.91,,,
1120927023,1.1,1.11,,,
1120927023,1.36,1.37,,,also locked mode after 1.36 sec. perhaps for hirex calibration.
1120927021,1.05,1.1,,,NTMs: a lot of activities t > 1.05 sec
1120927018,1.08,1.1,,,NTMs: difinitely one at 1.08 sec...
1120927019,1,1.1,,,NTMs: more activities 1.0-1.1 sec (long sawtooth...so this antenna phase may help in sawtooth)
1120927020,1.04,1.05,,,"NTMs: after 1.04 sec, presumably in H-mode. (a different regime: higher beta, also higher density)"
1120927018,1.1,1.11,,,"ntm at 1.1 is on all polar channels, also on channel 3 and 2 is the strange 50-60 khz mode outside of i-mode."
1120927017,1.18,1.19,,,NTMs: difinitely one at 1.18 sec...(this is the baseline shot?)
1120927010,1.4,1.41,,,ntm at 1.4 on channels 1 and 2. not sure if sig. on 2 is from humidity concerns (dryer now) or from geometric changes.
1120927007,1.4,1.41,,,small ntm signature on chn 1 at 1.4 sec
1120927003,1.4,1.41,,,small ntm signature on chn 1 at 1.4 sec
1110104019,0.73,,,,The long steady TM on shot#19 actually is triggered during/after an RF trip and H->L period. The subsequent L-H at .730 follows re-striking of both transmitters. The mode appears almost simultaneously with the L-H.
1110104035,0.8,0.81,,,"A little TM activity early, 0.8-0.9sec, 20-17kHz, N=-3"
1110104035,1.3,1.31,,,"and late 1.3-1.5sec, 20 falling to 12kHz, N=-3"
1110104034,0.92,0.93,,,"10kHz,N=-2, hard to see"
1110104034,1.24,1.25,,,"10kHz,N=-2, hard to see"
1110104030,0.8,0.81,,,"Single TM, N=-2, with overtone(?) .8sec tp 1.65sec (into rampdown) mostly around 10kHz, but drops rapidly to 7kHz 1.25-1.3sec, stays low to 1.49sec, rises back to 10 at 1.53 as RF power drops,  then falls to 5kHz during rampdown with RF at 1MW"
1110316018,0.97,0.98,,,"Observation of n=3 (probably m=4) NTM burst following sawtooth at t~0.97 to 1.05sec, and again at t~1.35 to 1.4sec at f~50kHz Mode seen clearly on Mirnov loops, also on FRCECE ch 3,4 and also on 7,8 but apparenlty not on ch 5,6. EFIT 4/3 surface is nominally at rmid=0.81m, which matches to FRECE ch4; FRCECE #7 is rmid~0.787m The nominal efit q at the inner channels on which the mode seems to appear would be 1.1 to 1.2. "
1110316018,1.34,1.36,,,
1110316031,1.23,1.25,,,There seem to be two different NTM's on this shot
1110316031,1.34,1.35,,,"70->60kHz between 1.34 and 1.37sec is n=4, maybe m=5. "
1110316020,1.25,1.26,,,"Yijun identified the strong mode (falling from ~60kHz to 40kHz) between 1.25 and 1.45sec in this shot as m/n=3/2, but  I'm finding that it looks like an n=3 mode. In particular, the BP_KA_TOP and BP_EF_TOP are almost 180degrees out of phase,  which means it's odd N."
1160826008,1.05,1.06,,,Nice locked mode 1.05s < t < 1.45s! Locks around 1s
1160928001,0.8,0.82,,,locked mode from 0.80 < t < 1.49
1090918006,1,1.05,,,There is a 40kHz rotating mode starting up between 1 and 1.05sec. that is a common signature.
1080520006,1.3,1.4,,,See a rotating mode around 55kHz starting about 1.35sec
1080109006,1.76,1.77,,,Large low frequency rotating MHD modes from 1.76 to 1.89 s.
1070828025,1,1.1,,,Large low frequency n=1 MHD mode from 1 to 1.15 s starting locked at zero frequency then increasing to about 1.9 kHz during the LH pulse. The mode is clearly visible on the raw magnetics signals as well as on the ECE. It is rotating in the electron direction.
1050415032,0.61,0.63,,,"Another early locked mode at .62sec, amd density was near 1.2e20."
